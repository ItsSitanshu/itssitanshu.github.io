        Agriculture in resource-constrained regions faces significant challenges due to the lack of affordable and accessible diagnostic tools.
        The project, Agro-ML, aims to address these issues by providing Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) services tailored for small-scale farmers in impoverished areas.
